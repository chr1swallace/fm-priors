We assume we have data summarising a single regression: \(\hat\beta\), the estimated effect of a genotype on an outcome, and \(\hat V\), its estimated standard error.  We assume \(\hat\beta\) is unbiased, that is \(\hat\beta \sim N(\beta, \hat V)\).

We consider two prior distributions for \(\beta\):

1. \(\beta \sim N(0,W)\)
2. \(\beta \sim L(0,\lambda)\)

where \(\lambda = \sqrt(W/2)\).
